Virtual CloudDrive
==========

This worked was bootstrapped by [UNINET Sigma](https://www.uninett.no/sigma), the Norwegian national HPC coordination organization.

The virtual clouddrive is a Website and WebDAV interface framework/product to cloud storage providers for the rest of us. Check the [[list of supported clients and platforms|Supported clients and platforms]]

_**The Use Case: organizations that want to provide easily accesible secure storage to their users with full encryption before data gets stored in the cloud**_

Features:
* Lots of native client support (Win7, OSX, iOS, Android, Linux) via WebDAV
* Tagging data and search based on tags
* world viewable public data
* federated access and enrollment via website
* transparent compression and encryption separated from actual storage (i.e. your data is secure: you hold the keys)
* pluggable back ends for storage (local filesystem, S3, ...)
* metering, quotas etc. built-in


This allows everyone to set up their own, super-scalable Internet storage. _**Your**_ storage.

It takes a bit of time and effort, but _**it is well worth it**_ if you want to provide _**a more private**_ storage service based on cloud back end technology (though a local filesystem will work, too).
