		<b>Windows 7</b><br/>
		On Windows 7 you can just use the built-in file manager (explorer). <br/>
		Click “create network drive” In the url field type “https://disk.beneathclouds.com”; next give your username and the password you chose when you activated the disk. You should see the disk in the file manager and be good to go! <br/><br/><br/>
		
		<b>Windows XP and Windows Vista</b><br/>
		On XP and Vista your mileage may vary - there is an endless list of service packs and bug fixes. Windows 7 does not have any of these problems and you may give it a try with the instructions for Windows 7.<br/>

		Otherwise on XP and Vista the consensus is that the <a href="http://www.bitkinex.com">freeware Bitkinex is the best client</a>. Download, install, and create a new WebDAV SSL connection to https://rightfabric.net  Use the username and password to connect.
