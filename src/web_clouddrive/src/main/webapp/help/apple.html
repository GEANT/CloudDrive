		On OS X there are three clients. For all three you need to connect to https://rightfabric.net, use your  username and your password to connect.<br/><br/><br/>
		
		<ol>
		<li>- the built in OS X Finder. Works, but isn't as fast as the next two. Nothing to install though!  To connect hit Cmd-K and go! </li><br/>
		<li>- Transmit (see App Store or http://www.panic.com/transmit/). By far the fastest option, but alas, commercial. Does other protocols (and does them fast) as well. Connect with WebDAV SSL and go! </li><br/>
		<li>- Cyberduck, see http://cyberduck.ch Open source, and between the previous two options in terms of speed. Again. connect WebDAV SSL and go!</li><br/>
