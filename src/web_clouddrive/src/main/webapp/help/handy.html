		Assuming you are connected to the disk interface, there are a few handy extra tricks you might want to know about: <br/><br/>
		<ul>
		<li>- Any file you upload to you /public folder will be visible to the world on https://righfabric.net/public/username/filename</li><br/>
		<li>- If you have tagged files on the webste, you can execute a query via the disk interface by creating a new folder right under the Metadata folder. Name it with the tags (separated by a space) you want to search on. </li><br/>
		<li>- If you upload a file named “foo” to a search folder, say /searches/some_search, and some_search  is defined by the tags “one two three”, the file “foo” will be tagged with “one two three” as well, and visible in the some_search folder. Actual storage of the data will be in the /common folder - that's why it's there. </li><br/>
		</ul>
