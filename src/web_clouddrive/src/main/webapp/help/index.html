		<span><b>Welcome to the landing page for the test phase of cloud drive! 10GB of free online storage in the test phase</b></span><br/><br/>
		
		
		<div>We're happy that you want to use the service and hope you'll gives us plenty of feedback and suggestions. As this is a closed  test phase, you can send all feedback (or a  request to participate) to us per email. </div>
		<br/>
		<b>Disclaimers:</b>
		<div>Disclaimer: this is a test phase! Data may get lost, corrupted, outages may occur, load may be too heavy for the deployment..... You know, all the usual nightmares. We're here to improve on that, and as said, we appreciate any feedback you have. Also, the website is fully functional but really needs a design(er). We're working on that. </div>

		<b>What is cloud backed storage?</b><br/><br/>
		
		<div>So what is this cloud backed storage? Well, to you, the end user, itâ€™s  just another disk, but with a WebDAV front end. <b>This means it will work on most devices without a client! </b>
		And of course  a website interface as well..... if you want to use that. A more detailed feature list (ever expanding...)  is located at the page with all of the features.</div>
