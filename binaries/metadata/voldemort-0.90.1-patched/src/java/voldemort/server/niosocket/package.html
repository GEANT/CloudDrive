    The Voldemort NIO socket server implementation.
    <p>
    The NIO server is enabled in the server.properties file by setting the 
    "enable.nio.connector" property to "true". If you want to adjust the number
    of SelectorManager instances that are used, change
    "nio.connector.selectors" to a positive integer value. Otherwise, the 
    number of selectors will be equal to the number of CPUs visible to the JVM.
