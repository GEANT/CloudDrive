    The Store interface is the primary interface for Voldemort. Stores provide functionality by implementing put, get, and delete from scratch
    or by decorating existing stores with additional capabilities. Implementations of this interface provide the network i/o layer,
    the various persistence layers, layers that deal with version conflicts, layers for logging and performance monitoring, etc.
